# ROS_pyControl

I'm looking for a way to use ROS in different situations.

In this project, Raspberry Pi and ROS were used instead of using PLC to control factory production equipment.

## summary

This is a device that automatically observes what is happening at the work site.

These information obtained by this device are used to improve the production site.

- A light sensor detects that the indicator light installed in the manufacturing facility is on.

- The CT sensor detects the amount of current flowing to the manufacturing facility.

- By pressing one of a plurality of push buttons arranged within reach of the operator, it is possible to know what the operator is currently doing.

- These measurements are periodically transferred to the database server installed at the factory.
